# New Haven City Transformation Plan dashboard v1

This repository houses a [draft](https://ct-data-haven.github.io/ctp-dash/) of the New Haven City Transformation Plan (CTP) dashboard built by [DataHaven](http://ctdatahaven.org).

## About the dashboard

The City of New Haven, in partnership with DataHaven, is piloting an online dashboard that makes tracking progress on key indicators of well-being and program performance easy and transparent. It contains a front page with an overview of indicators, and individual pages for each of the 8 CTP sectors--Adult Literacy, Community Cohesion, Community Health and Mental Health, Early Childhood, Economic Development, Education and Youth Development, Job Creation and Workforce Development, and Housing and Physical Environment--as well as a set of cross-sector measures.

## About the CTP

The City Transformation Plan is a guide for citywide improvement of New Haven communities across 8 sectors. Organizations involved in the CTP effort, as well as city government, will be tracking progress of indicators for each of these sectors at both population and programmatic levels.
